# Covid-19-Impacts-Analysis-Using-Python
The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, you are required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.

The dataset we are using to analyze the impacts of covid-19 is downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about:
1. The Country Code
2. Name Of All The Countries
3. Date Of The Record
4. Human Development Index Of All The Countries
5. Daily Covid-19 Cases
6. Daily Deaths Due To Covid-19
7. Stringency Index Of The Countries
8. The Population Of The Countries
9. GDP Per Capita Of The Countries

# Analyzing the Spread of Covid-19
An analysis of the spread of covid-19 in all the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases. First have a look at all the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases:

## Countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases

USA is comparatively having a very high number of covid-19 cases as compared to Brazil and India in the second and third positions. Next we look at the total number of deaths among the countries with the highest number of covid-19 cases

Just like the total number of covid-19 cases, the USA is leading in the deaths, with Brazil and India in the second and third positions. One thing to notice here is that the death rate in India, Russia, and South Africa is comparatively low according to the total number of cases.

# The stringency index. 
It is a composite measure of response indicators, including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans. It shows how strictly countries are following these measures to control the spread of covid-19:

# Human Development Index. 
It is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita indicators. Letâ€™s have a look at how many countries were spending their budget on the human development

# Conclusion
The spread of covid-19 among the countries and its impact on the global economy. We saw that the outbreak of covid-19 resulted in the highest number of covid-19 cases and deaths in the united states. One major reason behind this is the stringency index of the United States. It is comparatively low according to the population. I also analyzed how the GDP per capita of every country was affected during the outbreak of covid-19.
